# Issue Reporting and Priority Level Fixes

## Issues Identified:
1. ✅ **Issue not being saved** - Potential issues with dialog flow and error handling
2. ✅ **Operator doesn't have to define priority level** - Priority was hardcoded to medium
3. ✅ **Admin can assign technicians to issues** - Added technician assignment functionality

## Changes Made:

### ✅ lib/screens/dashboard/operator_dashboard.dart
- Added priority selection dropdown with all available priority levels (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL)
- Made priority selection mandatory with validation
- Added required field indicators (*) for title, description, and priority
- Improved error handling with proper validation messages
- Updated issue creation to use user-selected priority instead of hardcoded value
- Enhanced error handling to ensure issues are properly saved

### ✅ lib/screens/dashboard/admin_dashboard.dart
- Added technician assignment functionality with dropdown selection
- Added new "Assign Technician" button to issue list items
- Implemented technician selection from available technicians
- Updated issue status to "acknowledged" when technician is assigned
- Added proper error handling and success messages

## Features Added:
- **Operator Dashboard**:
  - Priority selection dropdown with all IssuePriority enum values
  - Required field validation for title, description, and priority
  - User-friendly error messages for missing fields
  - Visual indicators for required fields

- **Admin Dashboard**:
  - Technician assignment functionality
  - Real-time technician list loading
  - Automatic status update to "acknowledged" on assignment
  - Success/error notifications

## Testing Required:
- [ ] Test issue reporting with all priority levels
- [ ] Verify that issues are saved to Firebase with correct priority
- [ ] Test validation for empty fields in operator dashboard
- [ ] Test technician assignment functionality in admin dashboard
- [ ] Confirm error handling works for failed operations

## Files Modified:
- lib/screens/dashboard/operator_dashboard.dart
- lib/screens/dashboard/admin_dashboard.dart

## Files Not Modified (but verified):
- lib/models/issue_model.dart - Already supports priority and technician assignment
- lib/services/firebase_service.dart - Already has proper saveIssue and updateIssue methods
- lib/models/technician_model.dart - Already supports technician data structure
