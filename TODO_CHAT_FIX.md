# Chat System Implementation - Fix TechniciansManagement Widget

## Task: Fix TechniciansManagement widget to accept user parameter for proper chat functionality

### Steps Completed:

1. [x] Modified TechniciansManagement widget constructor to accept user parameter
2. [x] Updated _TechniciansManagementState to properly initialize currentUser from widget.user
3. [x] Removed all null checks and unnecessary null-safe operators since user is guaranteed
4. [x] Fixed FirebaseService method calls to use currentUser.id directly instead of null-safe operators
5. [x] Updated AdminDashboard to pass user parameter to TechniciansManagement

### Changes Made:

**File: lib/screens/dashboard/admin_dashboard.dart**

- Changed TechniciansManagement constructor to require user parameter
- Updated state class to properly initialize and use the user object
- Removed all `currentUser?.` null-safe operators since user is guaranteed
- Fixed all FirebaseService method calls to use `currentUser.id` directly

### Testing Required:

- [ ] Test that chat functionality works properly in Admin Dashboard
- [ ] Verify that unread message counts display correctly
- [ ] Test that private chat creation works between admin and technicians
- [ ] Ensure no null pointer exceptions occur during chat operations

### Notes:
- The user parameter is now properly passed from AdminDashboard to TechniciansManagement
- All chat functionality should now work without null reference errors
- The currentUser object is guaranteed to be non-null throughout the widget lifecycle
